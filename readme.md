- this branch is used to demonstrate the use of RTK query for the query (todo list) and mutations (toggle completed and delete functions) used in the todo tutorial.

- **note the dummy data API used in the tutorial does not actually mutate the server data, it only simulates the results in the payload. therefore, the results are not reflected in the UI.**

- the result(s) can however be seen in the Redux browser extension in the action tab.

- implemented the following features:
  - [x] pagination
  - [x] sorting
  - [x] filtering to show only completed or incomplete todos
