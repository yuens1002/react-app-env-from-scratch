- this Todo react project is meant to demonstrate a basic react app setup from scratch without running create-react-app. This project is modeled after Shuan Wassell's tutorial to suit the current build tools and other open source repos used from his tutorial.

- see the specific branch in this repo for the different store approaches used

- wanted thank Shaun Wassell https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaun-wassell/?trk=lil_instructor for providing his technical knowledge for working with a basic react development environment setup.
